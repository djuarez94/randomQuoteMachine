# randomQuoteMachine

My Positive Quote Machine is a web application that will give the user random positive quotes off a click of a button. It also gives the user the ability to share the quote on their Twitter and share the Positive Quote Machine to their Facebook account. The Positive Quote Machine uses some of the most famous people throughout history to help keep me, and hopefully others, motivated. 

The languages used for this project are:
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Javascript
