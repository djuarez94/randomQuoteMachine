# randomQuoteMachine

My Positive Quote Machine is a web application that will give the user random positive quotes off a click of a button. It also gives the user the ability to share the quote on their Twitter, and share the Positive Quote Machine to their Facebook account. These positive quotes are some of my favorite quotes from people that are well known through out our history, that I used to keep me motivated.
